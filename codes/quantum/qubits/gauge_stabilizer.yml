name: 'Gauge Stabilizer Codes'

introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0508131}'
description: 'Also called a subsystem stabilizer code. Intuitively, the idea is to create a stabilizer code with extra qubits attached to it that may aid in decoding. Note that this doesnt lead to new codes but does lead to new error correction and fault tolerance procedures. To create these codes proceed as follows. Choose \(2n\) operators \{ \tilde{X}_j,\tilde{Z}_j\}_{j=1}^n from \(\mathcal{P}_n\), the Pauli group on \(n\) qubits, such that they obey the same commutation relations as the regular \(n\)-qubit Pauli generators \( \{X_j,Z_j\}_{j=1}^n \) (the subscript on these latter operators indicates the single qubit the Pauli matrix acts on). The tilde operators might act on more than one physical (or \textit{bare}) qubit but they behave as if they acted only on a single qubit. WLOG we can choose a stabilizer group as \( \mathcal{S} = \langle Z_1,\dots,Z_s \rangle \). It follows that the normalizer of \(\mathcal{S} \) is \( N(\mathcal{S}) = \langle i, \tilde{Z}_1,\dots, \tilde{Z}_n, \tilde{X}_{s+1},\dots, \tilde{X}_n \rangle \). We now choose a gauge group as \( \mathcal{G} = \langle i, \tilde{Z}_1,\dots, \tilde{Z}_s, \tilde{X}_{s+1}, \tilde{Z}_{s+1}, \dots, \tilde{X}_{s+r}, \tilde{Z}_{s+r} \rangle \) with \( s + r \leq n \). The logical group is choosen as \( \mathcal{L} = N(\mathcal{S})/\mathcal{G} \simeq \langle \tilde{X}_{s+r+1},\tilde{Z}_{s+r+1}, \dots, \tilde{X}_n,\tilde{Z}_n \rangle \). Now the codespace \( C \) is as usual the \(+1\) eigenspace of the stabilizer \( \mathcal{S} \). But the gauge and logical groups have further decomposed this space into \( C = A \otimes B  \simeq (\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes k} \otimes (\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes r} \). Thus the Hilbert space is partitioned into 3 sets; \(k\) logical qubits, \(r\) gauge qubits, and \(s\) stabilizer qubits, with \(s+r+k=n\). '
protection: 'Just as for stabilizer codes, we measure the stabilizer generators to get a syndrome. A set of errors \( \{ E_a \} \) is correctable iff \( E_aE_b \not\in N(\mathcal{S}) - \mathcal{G} \) for all pairs \(a,b\). The distance of the code is the minimal weight of operators in \( N(\mathcal{S}) - \mathcal{G}\). A gauge stabilizer code thus has 4 parameters and is denoted by \( [[n,k,r,d]] \).'
